# x-exec

Simple convenience wrapper for doing synchronous shell stuff in node. Provides a few
helpful functions wrapping `child_process.execSync`:

```ts
import exec from 'x-exec';

// `err` is null | ErrData, `output` is whatever went to stdout
const [err, output] = exec(`which cowsay`);

// returns whatever would have gone to stdout
// but if there was an error, logs it and exits "1"
const output = exec.exit(`which cowsay`);

// swallows stdout, and just returns a boolean for exit code
const success = exec.success(`which cowsay`);
```
